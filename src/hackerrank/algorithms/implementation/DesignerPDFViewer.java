/**
 * When you select a contiguous block of text in a PDF viewer, the selection is
 * highlighted with a blue rectangle. In a new kind of PDF viewer, the selection
 * of each word is independent of the other words; this means that each
 * rectangular selection area forms independently around each highlighted word.
 * 
 * In this type of PDF viewer, the width of the rectangular selection area is
 * equal to the number of letters in the word times the width of a letter, and
 * the height is the maximum height of any letter in the word.
 * 
 * Consider a word consisting of lowercase English alphabetic letters, where
 * each letter is wide. Given the height of each letter in millimeters (), find
 * the total area that will be highlighted by blue rectangle in when the given
 * word is selected in our new PDF viewer.
 * 
 * Input Format:
 * 
 * The first line contains space-separated integers describing the respective
 * heights of each consecutive lowercase English letter (i.e., ). The second
 * line contains a single word, consisting of lowercase English alphabetic
 * letters.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 1 <= h <= 7 , 
 * Word contains no more than letters.
 * 
 * Output Format:
 * 
 * Print a single integer denoting the area of highlighted rectangle when the
 * given word is selected. The unit of measurement for this is square
 * millimeters (), but you must only print the integer.
 * 
 * Sample Input:
 * 1 3 1 3 1 4 1 3 2 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 
 * abc 
 * 
 * Sample Output:
 * 9
